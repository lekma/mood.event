Python libev interface

libev is an event loop: you register interest in certain events (such as a file
descriptor being readable or a timeout occurring), and it will manage these
event sources and provide your program with events.
To do this, it must take more or less complete control over your process (or
thread) by executing the event loop handler, and will then communicate events
via a callback mechanism.
You register interest in certain events by registering so-called event watchers,
which you initialise with the details of the event, and then hand over to libev
by starting the watcher.
